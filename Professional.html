            I've been obsessed with coding from a young age. I have been facinated ever since I learnt what coding entails, the fact that you give life to a program by just inputing some few elemenrs and data. Eventually, wuth the support of my family and friends I decided to embark on my coding journey. As of present I am learning the basics from a wonderful and amazing teacher.
